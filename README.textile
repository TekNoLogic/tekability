tekability is a simple durability frame based off "Fizzle":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5018-Fizzle.html.
It simply adds a percent to the equipment icons in the char panel.
Also provided is a "LibDataBroker":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1 datafeed for the overall average durability, with item details in the tooltip.

<em> tekability does not provide it's own display for the LDB datafeed, you will need a LDB-based display addon if youwish to use that. </em>
